# KazamiYuuka-cursor
Kazami Yuuka cursor made by [夜夢（よるむ）](https://www.pixiv.net/en/users/345405/artworks), ported to Linux using [win2xcur](https://github.com/quantum5/win2xcur)

The original size is only 32px so I upscale to different sizes using [AniTuner](https://www.gdgsoft.com/anituner) first before converting to Linux cursor so the image may not looking nice.

To install, simply put the cursor size that you want to /usr/share/icons and then change the cursor using the internal tool provided by your desktop environment.
